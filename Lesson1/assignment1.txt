The Significance of the meta charset utf-8

"UTF-8 (U from Universal Character Set + Transformation Formatâ€”8-bit) is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters (called code points) in Unicode. The encoding is variable-length and uses 8-bit code units."

UTF-8 is just another method of encoding characters to numbers and vice versa in the computer memory.
Other methods are ASCII, ANSI, etc, which have all been found to be limiting because they do not cover every notable characters.
This is what sets the UTF-8 apart from the rest of it. It lets you write texts in all languanges, highlighting every character as it is in that language.
